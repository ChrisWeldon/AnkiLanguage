## Anki Language Webapp
*A webapplication version AnkiTool CLI.*

Anki Spaced Repetition Software is great for studying all sorts of things, but suffers due to generality. Anki Language Webapp takes out the hassle of making anki work for language learners (currently supporting English, German, and French.) Easily create, manage, and export language vocab cards in an immersion setting. While consuming content or traveling in your target language, create vocab cards on the fly without the long pipeline.
